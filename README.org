  This is Rich Hickey's callback library...

  I've just renamed it to Functor.h (Peter Polidoro).

  3rd major revision
  Now functors are concrete classes, and should be held by value
  Virtual function mechanism removed
  Generic makeFunctor() mechanism added for building functors
  from both stand-alone functions and object/ptr-to-mem-func pairs

  To use:

  If you wish to build a component that provides/needs a callback, simply
  specify and hold a Functor of the type corresponding to the args
  you wish to pass and the return value you need. There are 10 Functors
  from which to choose:

  Functor0
  Functor1<P1>
  Functor2<P1,P2>
  Functor3<P1,P2,P3>
  Functor4<P1,P2,P3,P4>
  Functor0wRet<RT>
  Functor1wRet<P1,RT>
  Functor2wRet<P1,P2,RT>
  Functor3wRet<P1,P2,P3,RT>
  Functor4wRet<P1,P2,P3,P4,RT>

  These are parameterized by their args and return value if any. Each has
  a default ctor and an operator() with the corresponding signature.

  They can be treated and used just like ptr-to-functions.

  If you want to be a client of a component that uses callbacks, you
  create a Functor by calling makeFunctor().

  There are three flavors of makeFunctor - you can create a functor from:

  a ptr-to-stand-alone function
  an object and a pointer-to-member function.
  a pointer-to-member function (which will be called on first arg of functor)

  The current iteration of this library requires you pass makeFunctor()
  a dummy first argument of type ptr-to-the-Functor-type-you-want-to-create.
  Simply cast 0 to provide this argument:

  makeFunctor((target-functor*)0,ptr-to-function)
  makeFunctor((target-functor*)0,reference-to-object,ptr-to-member-function)
  makeFunctor((target-functor*)0,ptr-to-member-function)

  Future versions will drop this requirement once member templates are
  available.

  The functor system is 100% type safe. It is also type flexible. You can
  build a functor out of a function that is 'type compatible' with the
  target functor - it need not have an exactly matching signature. By
  type compatible I mean a function with the same number of arguments, of
  types reachable from the functor's argument types by implicit conversion.
  The return type of the function must be implicitly convertible to the
  return type of the functor. A functor with no return can be built from a
  function with a return - the return value is simply ignored.
  (See ethel example below)

  All the correct virtual function behavior is preserved. (see ricky
  example below).

  If you somehow try to create something in violation
  of the type system you will get a compile-time or template-instantiation-
  time error.

  The Functor base class and translator
  classes are artifacts of this implementation. You should not write
  code that relies upon their existence. Nor should you rely on the return
  value of makeFunctor being anything in particular.

  All that is guaranteed is that the Functor classes have a default ctor,
  an operator() with the requested argument types and return type, an
  operator that will allow it to be evaluated in a conditional (with
  'true' meaning the functor is set, 'false' meaning it is not), and that
  Functors can be constructed from the result of makeFunctor(), given
  you've passed something compatible to makeFunctor().
